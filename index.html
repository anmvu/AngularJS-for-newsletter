										<p style="margin:0;font-weight:bold">NYU Newsroom</p>
										<p style="margin-top:0.5em">When <strong>Professor Eli Pearce</strong>
									passed away on May 19, 2015, a slice of Poly history passed along with him.
									Pearce had been affiliated with the school, then known as the Polytechnic
									Institute of Brooklyn, since the mid-1950s, when he conducted his doctoral
									studies in chemistry here. As a student, he learned with such luminaries as
									Herman Frances Mark, who is often called the Father of Polymer Science, and
									Charles Overberger, another influential chemist who helped establish the
									study of polymers as a major sub-discipline.</p>

										Foundation, a group that teaches women to program video games</strong>.
										After I helped to start Code Liberation, people really started to pay
										attention. I also got better at making games through the process of
										teaching game development. Some say "those who can't,
										teach," but I think those who can should be the ones who teach.</p>
